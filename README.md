# asteroids

The 1979 Atari arcade space shooter game Asteroids, recreated in Javascript

## Overview

In order to play, run asteroids.html in your browser and make sure to turn the `AUTOMATION_ON` constant to `false`.
Use the left and right arrow keys to rotate the ship. Use the up arrow key to move forward, and hit spacebar to shoot.

You can change `NUM_SAMPLES` to vary training iterations and `OUTPUT_THRESHHOLD` to change the necessary accuracy in order for the spaceship to commit to a turn.
